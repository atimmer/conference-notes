## GrETEL Indexing

## Benchmark

* 87 example XPath queries taken from logs of GrETEL
* Baseline: standard SoNaR corpus
* Experiment: GrInd'ed SoNaR corpus

## Conclusion

Cost

* Significant increase in disk space requirement
* Not efficient on small database (but they are small anyway) or in general cases

Benefit
