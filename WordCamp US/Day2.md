# Presentations

## WordPress: The Next Generation – A Look Into WordPress Sites 5, 20, and 50 Years into the Future

Awesome talk with awesome videos. Main takeaway is that WordPress might be everywhere, embedded into systems (I immediately thought about the Rasberry PI)

## Make WP_CLI Work For You: Extending WP_CLI With Custom Commands

Interesting talk about adding commands to WP-CLI. 

Takeaways for Yoast: We could add a few commands. Recalculate would be a very good command for Yoast SEO but isn't really possible now that calculation is in JS.

## Accessibility: Proven, easy integration into design and development workflows

This disability community is a group that anyone can join at any time. If you have a bike accident you can end up not being able to use a mouse.

Basically accessibility isn't hard, you just have to add certain things.

## Unite and Prosper: How WordCamp Europe helped reinvigorate WordPress communities
Luca Sartoni

Good talk that didn't have enough people in the room. This topic might just not interest Americans very much.

## Lunch

## Godzilla CSS
Michael Arestad

"Try to avoid OS specific tools" -- Michael Arestad. I thought Makefile was unix specific, but there is a windows version as well.

Takeaways:
* Architecture rules
* CSS code standards
* Contributions rules & guidelines

## Robots Write the Docs
Luke Woodward

A talk about Luke's exploration into how to use WP-Parser to generate documentation. I kinda want to copy this talk now with some extra additions I have from helping build WP-Parser and DevHub.

## Take Care of Each Other: How to Contribute to WordPress Without Writing Code
Rich Robinkoff

Emotional talk about how to take care of each other.

## Navigating Today’s Website Threats!! – A Stroll Through WordPress Security
Tony Perez

A passionate talk by Tony that put's security on your radar again.

## State of the word
Matt Mullenweg

I really liked that Matt put Scott on stage, I really hope this is something he will keep doing in the next years. It's one thing if Matt says something, but seeing the people that actually build the thing speak up is very refreshing.

One thing I didn't like was that Matt highlighted Calypso. WordCamp US and the commmunity summit should be mainly about .org, when you say "We" on stage referring first to the WordPress community and then to Automattic (which build Calypso) the confusion between .org and .com that has always been present is worsened.
