# Contributor day

## Working on Parser

After seeing the talk "Robots Write the Docs" by Luke Woodward I was really inspired to start working on the parser again. When he showed up at the contributor day and wanted to work on the parser as well I was overjoyed. He already had a patch ready to support namespaces in the parser and after some changes I merged that into the parser.

Eric Mann was working on making it possible to import JSDoc output into WordPress as post types because that is how DevHub works right now. The reason for custom post types is also now clear to me, because people want to work in WordPress because they have experience in that. Contrast that with flat HTML files that phpdocumentor and JSDoc produce a WordPress site with posts is much more approachable for most WordPress developers.

## Lunch with the meta team

Everyone was instructed to go to the reading terminal market with a $15 gift card to buy their own lunch. This was a great experience except for the fact that there were too many people in that market. So there was no place to sit down. With the meta team we ended up returning to the convention center to eat our lunch.

Lunching with your team during the contributor day is a great idea and I think every WordCamp should encourage this. Because people on the meta team all work at different companies it was really nice to find out about how things are going at other companies.
