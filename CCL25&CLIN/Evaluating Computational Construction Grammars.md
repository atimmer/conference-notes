# Evaluating Computational Construction Grammars

## Fluid Construction Grammar

* Bidirectional (comprehension/formulation)
* Unification-based (match and merge)
* Robustness, flexibility and open-endedness and learning
* General-purpose, but focus on multi-agent systems

## Evaluation Requirements

* Grammaticality judgement irrelevant
* Evaluation of semantics
* Bidifrectionality
* Different kinds of meaning representations

## Comprehension

* Smatch score
* Semantic coherence
* Average branching factor of search process
