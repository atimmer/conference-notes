# Building a Parallel Meaning Bank for English, Dutch, German and Italian

## Annotate & (re)Train

Explore -> Annotate -> Retrain -> Reprocess -> Explore

## Idea

Preserving meaning is the most important thing in translating

## Goals & Questions

* Exploit translations and NLP tools for English to build the **tools for other languages**.
* Learn more about wide-coverage (cross-lingual)
* Study translations from a semantic perspective.

## From GMB to PMB

Groningen Meaning Bank -> Parallel Meaning Bank

One language -> Four languages

English, Dutch, German, Italian

## Methodology

1. Segmentation (??? everybody -> every body ???)
2. Syntactic Parsing (token -> category (Combinatory Categorial Grammar)
3. Universal Semantic tagging (more semantically motivated than POS tagging)
4. Symbolization (lemmatization, normalization and some disambiguation)
5. Bits of wisdom (manual)
6. a
7. (Cross-language projection)

* Can we learn accurate semantic parsers for other languages exploiting translations?
* Can we use of language-neutral tools in computational semantics?
* What do we learn about the compositional and lexical semantics of a single language (English)
