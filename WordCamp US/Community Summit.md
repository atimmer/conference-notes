# Community Summit

## Discussion day

I had put in a proposal topic to discuss at the discussion day called "Composer for meta". It turned out there weren't much people that wanted to talk about that so we didn't discuss the topic. Other topics that did get discussed were "How to learn javascript to WordPress developers", "A European community summit" and "A long term roadmap for WordPress".

Discussing important topic with fellow contributors to WordPress was very enlighting and educating. It gave me new perpectives that I hadn't considered before and it really humanizes to have someone discuss their views with you.

## Working day

My perspective on the community summit working day, everyone came in, sat down and started working. It felt like everybody in that room knew how to do what they came to do. I wanted to say hi to Taco a few times but him and the other members of the polyglot team were in such concentration that I didn't want to interupt them.

After the discussion day I was really wanted to build a javascript parser to get javascript documentation into DevHub. So this is what I worked on during the working day. The only problem is that currently the javascript in core isn't that good. So I set up a [mirror of WordPress develop][mirror] and made travis auto generate [WordPress JSDoc][jsdoc].

The JS documentation is very poor, but that's because the inline documentation in WordPress is poor. I digged into the code to what we need to fix and prepared a make/core post to publish my results and how we can improve it. Because of the auto reparsing of my mirror we can then easily see improvements once we improve the inline documentation.

## Overall

At times I felt very small in the room, wondering why I was invited to this place with a huge number of big names that we've all seen a ton of in the WordPress community. These feelings are not easily supressed by knowing it's not true. There is a reason I received an invite to the summit and I shouldn't feel this way, but I still do.

This was the first community summit I attended and I had a blast. It really highlighted the parts of the WordPress community I love: People focused. WordPress is the community.
